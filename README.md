# Slope-Curves---Jupyter-Notebook
A Jupyter Notebook freely available to help researches investigate non-adiabatic AC calorimetry data for instrument issues and non-linear heat losses
The notbook is created such that it should be possible for users without programming experience to use the notebook to perform analysis on their own AC-calorimetic data. 

# Install Python and JupyterLab
To run the script you need to install both Python (the programming language used in the script) and JupyterLab (the user interface where you will run and edit the script to read your own files)

The following videos can be used to help you install both Python and JupyterLab:
**Windows**:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQ47rIO5bTw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQ47rIO5bTw)  \
**MacOS**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7zOkRubIrU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7zOkRubIrU). When you get to typing the command *pip3 install notebook* instead type *pip install jupyterlab*. 

Addditionally the steps are described here. 
1. Install Python from the official Python homepage: [](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Run the python installer
3. Confirm corret installation: Open the terminal and type python:

   Close the terminal.
5. Install JupyterLab. Open the terminal again.
   
   Windows: type *pyton -m pip install jupyterlab*
   
   MacOS: *pip install jupyterlab*
   
   After the installation has finished close the terminal
7. Open JupyterLab:
   
   Open the terminal again.
   
   Windows: type *pyton -m jupyterlab* and wait for the program to open in a browser window.

# Download the Slope-curves repository: 


# Run the code 

# Start using the code: 
For this part the instruction are given inside the Jupyter Notbook. 
- Good luck :)
