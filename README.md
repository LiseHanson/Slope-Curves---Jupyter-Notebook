# Slope-Curves---Jupyter-Notebook
A Jupyter Notebook freely available to help researches investigate non-adiabatic AC calorimetry data for instrument issues and non-linear heat losses
The notbook is created such that it should be possible for users without programming experience to use the notebook to perform analysis on their own AC-calorimetic data. 

# Install Jupyter Notebook


# Download the Slope-curves repository: 


# Run the code 

# Start using the code: 
For this part the instruction are given inside the Jupyter Notbook. 
- Good luck :)
