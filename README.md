# Slope-Curves---Jupyter-Notebook
A Jupyter Notebook freely available to help researches investigate non-adiabatic AC calorimetry data for instrument issues and non-linear heat losses
The notbook is created such that it should be possible for users without programming experience to use the notebook to perform analysis on their own AC-calorimetic data. 

# Install Python and JupyterLab
To run the script you need to install both Python (the programming language used in the script) and JupyterLab (the graphical user interface where you will run and edit the script). 

The following videos can be used to help you install both Python and JupyterLab:  
**Windows**:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQ47rIO5bTw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQ47rIO5bTw)  
**MacOS**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7zOkRubIrU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7zOkRubIrU). This video is for installing Jupyter notebook, which would also work fine. However I would recommend JupyterLab. Thus whenever you are are asked to type something with `... notebook` in your terminal instead type `... jupyterlab` ( e.g. when asked to type `pip3 install notebook` instead type `pip install jupyterlab`). 

Addditionally the steps are described here. 
1. Download the Python installer from the official Python homepage: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Install the newest version. Choose add python.exe to PATH when asked by the installer. 
2. Run the python installer which you have downloaded.
3. Confirm corret installation: Open the terminal and type `python`:   
   Close the terminal.
5. Install JupyterLab. Open the terminal again.  
   Windows: type `pyton -m pip install jupyterlab`     
   MacOS: `pip install jupyterlab`
   pip is a program used to install packages in python. 
   After the installation has finished close the terminal  
7. Open JupyterLab:  
   Open the terminal again.  
   Windows: type `pyton -m jupyter lab`
   MacOS: type `jupyter lab`  
   Wait for the program to open in a browser window
   **Success, you have installed both Python and Jupyter**

# Intsall widget package (Optional):  
The plots in JupyteLab can become interactive such that you can zoom on selected regions of the plots. I personally find this very usefull, and thus I reccomend doing this optional step. 
1. Close the JupyterLab tab in your browser.
2. Close the terminal
3. Open a new terminal and type:  
   Windows: `python -m pip install ipympl`  
   MacOS: `pip install ipympl`
   Wait for the installation to finish  
   If you want more information in the ipympl package visit [https://matplotlib.org/ipympl/](https://matplotlib.org/ipympl/)

# Run the code 

# Start using the code: 
For this part the instruction are given inside the Jupyter Notbook. 
- Good luck :)
